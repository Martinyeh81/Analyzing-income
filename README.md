# Analyzing-income

## Summary
This project discusses whether a person’s income is greater than (or less than) $50K per year, so our goal doesn’t depend on the accuracy score. We have to see f1-score. Comparing all model, the accuracy, precision and recall of Random Forest are beeter than others, so we can find Random Forest is the best model.


## Skill
